# Third-Party Method Status

## Included Snapshots

  - Maintained by upstream authors; local copy is for integration/benchmark reference.

- `fold-opt-package/`
  - Source snapshot included for folded optimization methods.
  - Contains multiple example projects and duplicated vendor files by design.

## Referenced but Not Included

- `LCGLN`
  - Mentioned in planning/notes.
